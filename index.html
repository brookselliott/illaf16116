    <h1>I love looking at faces</h1>
    <p>
        <!-- mission statement/declaration/introduction --> <!-- The goal of this site, is to focus on indigenous beauty.
        I am the author of this site. I'm thinking I'll start by linking to the posts of various indigenous professional models on instagram.
      
        I think I'm going to need help to find and link to them, thank you for your contributions.-->
      
        I'm a professional digital photographer, however this site/project is not-for-profit.<br>
        Seeing the eyes of indigenous models inspires me, I want you to see them and be inspired too.<br>
        And I don't have to work around instagram's discover feature trying to goad me.<br>
        
        I'm writing this with full transparency, so prepare for stream-of-consciousness, free-flowing as art<br> 
        The way I used to develop things going back to geocities.com, lol<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    To do list<br>
    <ul>
      <li>locate more models' profiles or frankly just do shoots&hellip;I want contribution &amp; consent and not to flood someone's quiet profile with heavy traffic from an unknown source.</li> <!-- this may turn into a long-term project and not just armchair effort from instagram, for you however dear reader, i encourage you to network and get consent via direct messages  and to always give credit-->
      <li>github</li>
